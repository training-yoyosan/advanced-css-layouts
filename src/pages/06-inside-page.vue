        <p>
          Your idea is going to be BIG. You just know it. But before you hire
          your favorite developer to go build it, take a step back. Creating a
          brand-new product is a risk; many of them fail within their first
          year. Is there a proven way to set yourself up for success?
        </p>
        <p>
          Yes! All it takes is some preparation. By taking the time to do
          upfront validation, planning and iterating before you build, you can
          avoid ideas that flop and create a product that exceeds expectations.
        </p>
        <h2>Execute each lesson using the accompanying workbook</h2>
        <p>
          Upon purchase you'll receive a confirmation email with instructions on
          how to download your workbook, as well as a notice when your physical
          copy has shipped.
        </p>
        <p>
          The workbook, an editable PDF file, is essential. It is full of
          activities and guidance for implementing at every step.

I've given you book.html, an inside page layout for the website. It has its own stylesheet, inside.css. This stylesheet is purely "pretty" stuff -- there's nothing in it pertaining to layout.

Go back to layout.css and see if you can edit this stylesheet to apply to the book.html page.

Screenshots for the book page are included so you know how the page should look.

HINTS:

- Where are the flex containers/parents and the flex items/children?

- What layouts do you want at each dimension? How do they change?
